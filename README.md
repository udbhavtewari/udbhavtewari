## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Udbhav Tewari

I love playing around with Data with my analytical skills to build side projects around business problems, sports and anything which seems intriguing to me. I love the intersection of Business + Tech since it gives me the right amount of challenge yet growth. Active on Twitter & LinkedIn.
